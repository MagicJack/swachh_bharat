Estimating the volume of a garbage dump from multiple images taken from a mobile phone camera. We use methods like sliding window segmentation using deep neural networks, 3D reconstruction using SIFT features, and volume estimation using Poisson surface reconstruction.


There are 3 folders corresponding to the three steps:
	Segmentation,
	3DReconstruction,
	Volume Estimation
